    <h3>About this Map</h3>
    <p>These maps depict the tusnami evacuation zones (shaded in pink) developed by your county civil defense agency.  These evacuation zones provide the minimu safe evacuation distance.</p>
    <p>These are the same zones that are published in the Hawaiian Telecom Yellow Pages and available from your local civil defense agency.</p>
    <p>In the event of a locally generated tsunami, you may only have minutes to evacuate! If you feel the ground shaking, a locally generated tsunami may be occurring. Move to higher ground immediately, well away from the evacuation zone and low-lying coastal areas.</p>
    <p>Kaua'i Civil Defense asks that where feasible, persons leaving the evacuation areas should proceed to at least the 100' elevation contour/level shown on the map in red, so as not to cause traffic congestion in or near evacuation zones.</p>
